    "This looks about right. With this data set, you are able to train a model to predict the sentiment of a sentence. Take a quick moment to think about how you would go about predicting the data.\n",

    "One way you could do this is to count the frequency of each word in each sentence and tie this count back to the entire set of words in the data set. You would start by taking the data and creating a vocabulary from all the words in all sentences. The collection of texts is also called a corpus in NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vocabulary in this case is a list of words that occurred in our text where each word has its own index. This enables you to create a vector for a sentence. You would then take the sentence you want to vectorize, and you count each occurrence in the vocabulary. The resulting vector will be with the length of the vocabulary and a count for each word in the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting vector is also called a feature vector. In a feature vector, each dimension can be a numeric or categorical feature, like for example the height of a building, the price of a stock, or, in our case, the count of a word in a vocabulary. These feature vectors are a crucial piece in data science and machine learning, as the model you want to train depends on them.\n",

In this case, you’ll use the baseline model to compare it to the more advanced methods involving (deep) neural networks, the meat and potatoes of this tutorial.\n",

    "<b>Overfitting</b> is when a model is trained too well on the training data. You want to avoid overfitting, as this would mean that the model mostly just memorized the training data. This would account for a large accuracy with the training data but a low accuracy in the testing data.\n",
